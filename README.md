If you've used a PocketCHIP, you might be like me and wanted to figure out how to use the GPIO pins on the top.

You might've even gone on the documentation and found out that there's two options, either a python API or the filesystem.

I wanted to be able to use C++ so I figured I would make a C++ API.
